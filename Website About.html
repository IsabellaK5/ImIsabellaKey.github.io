    <p class = "why-description"> 
    Why did I create this website? I originally got the idea from a 
    few of my computer science classmates as they described creating a resume website as the 
    perfect way to not only showcase your accomplishments, but also develop new skills. Since front 
    end development is a topic I aspire to learn more about, I decided creating this website would be the
    perfect opportunity.  </p>

    <p class = "how-description">   
    Prior to creating this resume website, I had little to no knowledge in front end 
    development, but as someone who loves to learn new things, I was up for the challenge. Using online coding
    tutorials, such as W3Schools and Mozilla Developer, helped me become more confident in my skills. The coding 
    languages I learned for this project included HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For my source code editor, I use
    Visual Studio Code.  
    Not only did I incorporate technical aspects of coding, but I also took the time to brush up on my skills
    of art and design. All the artistic elements of the website are personally made, from the handpicked color
    palette to the teacup drawings on the Projects page. For the typefaces, I used Google Fonts. In addition, I used 
    a myriad of graphics and illustration platforms such as Adobe Illustrator, Procreate, and Inkscape.
    </p>

    <p class = "inspiration-description">     
        During the ideation phase, I wanted my website to take its users on a 
        delightful journey as they get to know me better.  And so, the questions asks: who am I? For starters,
        my name is Isabella. I am a Computer Science student at Maryville University. I love all things pink and
        I especially love flowers and nature. Creating art is a hobby of mine as well as reading. I love being able 
        to immerse myself in a creative world where anything is possible. 
        Too often in the world of science, technology, engineering, and math, there is an immense pressure to reject 
        femineity to better fit in. Pink is often unfairly associated with a lack of professionalism. In addition, 
        elements of art and design can be overlooked in favor of creating a sleek and minimalist look. When I 
        originally got the idea for this website, I was afraid of associating the theme to a pastel, floral look 
        because it might be seen as “too girly” or unserious. But that is the exact reason why I decided to go for 
        it. I want my website to fully embody a fantastical art piece with a cottagecore aesthetic, characterized by
        a pastel color palette illustrating elements of natural and floral designs. This visual approach plays to a 
        more elegant and timeless feel while incorporating and highlighting the recent personal and academic 
        accomplishments I have made.   </p>
    
    <p class = "future-description"> 
    The world of technology is always changing, and as someone who loves 
    learning new things, I know I will never get bored! Not only that, but I, myself, will also change. 
    Whether it be highlighting new accomplishments, improving technological skills, or discovering new 
    passions and delights, my resume will always feature new details. Because of this, my website will 
    also be ever changing. Be sure to check back in the future to discover what new developments have been made! </p>
